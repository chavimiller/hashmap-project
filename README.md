# hashmap-project

This project implements a HashMap data structure from scratch using vanilla JavaScript to learn hands-on how key–value storage works under the hood. 
The class includes methods for adding, retrieving, updating, and removing entries, as well as utilities for accessing all keys, values, and entries. 
It uses buckets (arrays of pairs) to handle collisions and automatically resizes when the load factor is exceeded to maintain efficiency. 
The project focuses on understanding hashing functions, modular design, and algorithmic problem-solving.
The hashmap is then tested in a separate file.
